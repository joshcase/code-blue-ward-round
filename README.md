### 🏥 &nbsp;Code Blue Example Project #6

# 💻&nbsp;Ward Round Automation Script

📖 &nbsp;An example project from my book [**"Code Blue: An Introduction to Programming for Doctors and Medical Students"**](https://gumroad.com/products/NMtSD/).

💊&nbsp;In this project, we build a script that will automate many of the tasks that a junior doctor might do on their ward round.

🙅‍&nbsp;Please note, while these guidelines are loosely based on Australian standards, if you’re treating actual patients, please get your advice from elsewhere. The algorithm has been greatly abridged for the purposes of simplicity and teaching programming. **Not intended for clinical use**.

📁 &nbsp;All the projects in *Code Blue* contain multiple folders. The folder **final** contains the completed project, whereas any folder prefixed with **milestone** indicates some partially completed stage of the build. Feel free to review these as you follow along, to ensure your project is coming along as expected. 

‼️&nbsp;If you've got questions or problems, feel free to post them in the [Issues](https://github.com/joshcase/code-blue-ward-round/issues) tab.

✅ &nbsp;Pull requests welcome.
